What about a commuter game?

Game starts with a button: [take a step]

The mission is to get from A to B. (on a flat plane? Welcome to Flatland!)
We don't know where B is, but it is very very far away.

The global counter can be 'meters progressed'.

Commute levels:
- walking
- scooting
- cycling
- flying carpet
- rickshaw
- coach and horses
- motorcycling
- taxi
- car
- bus
- train
- hovercraft
- plane
- helicopter
- blip
- ferry
- submarine
- ship
- sideways elevator
- rocket car
- teleport


You can travel 3 ways:
- land
- water
- air

Perhaps the player can focus their efforts in one place.
E.g. go from swimming to Phelpsing (like super swimming) to skiing, to boating, to submarining, to water-rocketing (?).

Also, your realism level can alter your modes of transport:
- science
- magic

Science opens up the usual stuff: faster cars, and eventually rockets.
Magic has wings, flying carpets, more feet, etc.
Perhaps they both eventually end up with teleporting.

Each of the commute levels is something that needs to be researched.
You can max out going on foot:
- baby steps
- jog
- run
- leap
- better shoes
- sprung shoes
- hover shoes

I.e. you can end up going very fast on foot, but at some point you have to start investing in machines.
The first tech could be cycling:
- scooter
- tricycle
- bicycle
- racing bicycle
- ultra-light carbon fibre bicycle

The latter, then reached, would be faster than "hover shoes" had you stuck to commuting on foot.

# How to make money

Some ideas:

- be branded. The advertiser pays money for you to carry a placard, or wear a mascot suit, etc. It will slow you down, but make you money
- give someone a lift. For walkers, you could piggyback someone. For drivers, you can give someone a lift. Again, it will slow you down, but make you money.
- You've travelled N metres, but you can go back to N-M meters to get cash from a benefactor.

Or perhaps the entire point could be to for you to shift as many people from A to B. If you're a walker, you can piggyback one person. If you're a cyclist, you can convert your bike into a rickshaw and carry 2 people. And so forth, until you have a transport empire with many rickshaws, taxis, buses, trains, etc.

You can monopolise land transport, then "start over" on water, air. Good luck piggybacking someone in the water, though.

# Disasters

- potholes
- thieves, or people who don't pay you, or who rob you
- taxes
- toll charges
- natural disasters, e.g. an earthquake ruins your railway

# Mitigate

- insurance
- better tech (e.g. diamond railways so it never breaks)
