Allow disasters. You then lose work.
Some research, hence kit can mitigate against losing a bunch of work.

# Good vs Evil

This game can turn very sinister.
You can research the best tech money can buy but still only care about writing the great World novel.

E.g. research

- espionage to steal others' work.
- poison, to poison your fellow authors so they can't get ahead

There's a possibilty here to chose a path, good or evil.
Evil can provide great initial gains, but ruin you as a person.
Good can be a slog, but provide great long-term benefits. (give money to charity? Teach kids to write?)
Or perhaps there could be a cosy middle ground. You can poison your largest competitor, but still be charitable.

# Sci-fi

The game can get a scifi twist.
Move on from paper, from laptops, from even thinking words.
Have AIs write for you.
Have your words beamed to other worlds using gravitational waves or neutrinos.  (inter-galactic marketing?)
