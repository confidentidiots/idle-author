for all the stuff below...

make layers.

make a layer underneath the current data.
The current data has "money" but the layer underneath can re-define what money is.
It can be age-defined:
- prehistory age, money = shells
- mercantile age, money = IOUs
- agricultural age, money = trade

Each age is unlocked by the pinacle research item of the previous age.

--------


- show :ticker entries as events happen
- introduce research.

research will complete after N seconds
it will unlock a category
a category could be:
- writing instruments
- media
- electronics (for laptop)
- hire (for amanuensis)
- bourgeoisie life (for country cottage)

there are just ideas.


College (like research)
List courses. Worse to better. Cheaper to more expensive.
With every new course:
- write better quality words
- unlock the ability to write lengthier pieces
- reset the log decay on a certain type

Materials
- pencil
- pen
- ink
- paper
- typewriter ink
- battery for laptop
- sustenance for amanuensis
- nuclear core for MarkovWriterâ„¢

Research
One starts with primitive writing implements:
- stick in the sand
- rock scratches on bark
- ochre on cave walls
Upgrades/levels:
For writing:
- stick
- rock
- ochre
- charcoal
- pencil
- plume
- pen
- mechanical pencil
- typewriter
- laptop
- MarkovWriter (which just comes up with the words now)
For duplication/printing:
- an army of writers/duplicators
- printing press
- printers
- ... A way for your words to just appear on other media
The printing can go from small-scale to large-scale. E.g. 1xprinter, 2xprinters. One book at a time printing press, 5 books at a time, etc.
